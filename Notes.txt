"This should be my second self-learning programming project that I am doing. I am learning this from a video from FreeCodeCamp. For these notes, I am going to be doing an outline consisting of:
	The finished code of the chapter
	The explanation of each line of the code
	If something needs to be said/explained about the code."
Goals:
	" My goal is to be able to make a basic copy of three Wikipedia pages that reference themselves using all the things I learn."
Recorded dates:
	" Start: 5/1/2023
	 End: 6/4/2023"

End Notes:
	" First, this took so long became of my lack of motivation. I should have been able to do it within 3 days but now it took me over a month. I said my goal is to make a copy of wikipedia but I think I need to be able to do CSS and Javascripe first. So that will have to wait. Learning about HTML was quite easy, I understood everything quickly. I, however, was not able to remember the format and elements to use but I do have the idea of where to find the information I need. Now, it is time to move on to CSS.

Chapter 1 Start --------



Chapter 1 Code Explanation:
	-<!DOCTYPE html>
		- Tells the broswer what document type it is.
		- Not a tag or element.
	-<html lang="en"> </html>
		- This is the outline of all HTML code.
		- lang="en" tells the browser what language the webpage is in.
		- Needed to prevent output errors.
	-<head> </head>
		- Here is where we store metadata.
		- <meta charset="UTF-8">
			- This is to tell the browser what character set we are using.
			- Basically, what character set we are using.
			- <title> </title>
				- This will be the name of the webpage, what you see on the tab of the browser.
			- <style> </style>
				- Is some CSS code to format the webpage.
				- It makes the webpage dark mode.
				- It makes the webpage font size 22 pixels.
	-<body> </body>
		- What everything that is shown in the webpage.
	-<h1> </h1>
		- Inside the body element.
		- A heading element.
	-<p> </p>
		- Inside the body element.
		- A paragraph element.

Chapter 1 Notes:
	- HTML is used for outlining a webpage.
		- CSS is used for the appearance/presentation of the webpage.
		- JavaScript is used for the functionality/behavior of the webpage.
		- However, HTML connects all of these together.
			- HTML alone will be mainly used in something like reader mode.
				- Reader mode will show the most important outline of the page, which is what HTML does.
	- HTML code consists of elements and tags.
	- Elements are defined by a start tag and an end tag, usually with the format of <element> and </element>.
	- Doctype is not an HTML element or tag. It just tells the browser what document it is expecting.
	- <html> </html>
  		- This is where everything in the HTML code is under, the bread of the sandwich.
  		- We also need to declare the language of the document to tell the browser and not make it output error codes.
	- <head> </head>
  		- This is where we store metadata.
  		- Metadata is things that are not shown on the webpage but are used by it, such as how to format it, who wrote it, location of images we need, etc.

Chapter 2 Code Explanation:

	-<meta name= "" content="">
		- The meta tag is used to store data used by the broswer
		- Name is what the mata tag is describing

		- Typical meta tags
			- <meta name="author" content="Joe Lam"
				- mata data of author
				- describing the author as Joe Lam
			- <meta name"description" content="description of website">
				- meta data of descripiption of page
				- describing the descripition of the page
	-<link ref="" href=""type="">
		- link is to connect something to the code
		- ref is what is being connected to the code
		- href is where is it being conncted from
		- type is what is the file type of it.
		- <link ref="icon" href="html5.png" type="image/x-icon">
			- link an icon
			- from same folder tree named html5.png
			- with the type of image/x-icon
		- <link ref="stylesheet" href="main.css" type="text/css">
			- link a stylesheet
			- from the same folder tree named main.css
			- with the type of text/css
Chapter 2 Notes:
	- This chapter is about typical meta tags you would see
	- Meta tags are used by the broswer but not seen on the website
		- It could be used by soemthting like a search engine to look for our webpage

				-"<"
			-&gt;
				-">"
			-&copy;
				- copyright sign
			-&nbsp;
				- tab
			-https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references
				- Some more entities
		= HTML comment
			- <!-- -->
				

Chapetr 3 notes:
	- Things in the body element is like writing a book 
		- header elements are like titles and paragaph elements are body of texts
		- So, that's how we are suppose to struture our webpage.
		- CSS will later decide how our webpage looks
	- Whitespace Collapsing
		- In html white spaces are ignored
			- if you typed spaces or newlines it will be ignored.
